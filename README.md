# PHP Falsy Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP functions:  failure to properly handle falsy values (0, false, "", null).  The `bug.php` file contains a function with this issue.  The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to correct the issue.

## Bug Description

The function `my_function` correctly handles `null` values, but it does not account for other falsy values. This can lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected results if these values are passed as arguments.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for all falsy values using a more comprehensive condition.
